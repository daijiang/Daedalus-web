# Are Food Web complex?

Cool kids throw around the word _complexity_ a lot. The notion underlying the hype is that ecosystem, described in terms of ecological networks, are the outcome of evolutionary and ecologic processes --- not _random_ structures. Thus, cool kids _expect_ them to be significantly more _complex_ of what expected under some _null model_. As a corollary, cool kids _expect_ ecological network complexity to be higher were the complexity of the evolutionary and ecologic processes is higher.

Here, we try to cut through the hype, briefly reviewing the various heuristical definition of ecosystem / food webs complexity. Moreover, we introduce rigorous definitions of graph complexity in the ecological scenario, presenting both deterministic (Kolmogorov) and probabilistic definitions. We discuss how the heuristic definition may be related to the more rigorous definitions.

To ground the discussion we put to test the main notion, asking (i) wether food webs are indeed more complex than random graphs. Finally, we explore the corollary, asking (ii) wether the complexity of food webs is correlated with any of the other large spectrum biodiversity trends: are tropical food webs more complex than high latitude ones? are microbial food webs more complex than non microbial ones?
